#base of triangle 
base = int(input("Enter the Base of Triangle:"))
#height of triangle
height = int(input("Enter the Height of Triangle:"))
#area of triangle
area = (height*base)/2
#calucalting the area of triangle with specific base and height 
print("The area of Triangle is:" + str(area))
