"""
Write a Python program to check if every consecutive sequence of zeroes is followed by a consecutive sequence of ones of same length in a given string. Return True/False.
Original sequence: 01010101
Check if every consecutive sequence of zeroes is followed by a consecutive sequence of ones in the said string:
True
Original sequence: 00
Check if every consecutive sequence of zeroes is followed by a consecutive sequence of ones in the said string:
False
Original sequence: 000111000111
Check if every consecutive sequence of zeroes is followed by a consecutive sequence of ones in the said string:
True
Original sequence: 00011100011
Check if every consecutive sequence of zeroes is followed by a consecutive sequence of ones in the said string:
False
